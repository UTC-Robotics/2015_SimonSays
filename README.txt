# README for SimonSays project 
#   (code for PIC microcontroller used in SimonSays subsystem of the 2015 Competition team) 
#   
#   The following files are actually used... 
#   Main: playSimon.c 
#   Addntl: ADC_init.h  ADC_init.h  simonFunctions.h  simonFunctions.c 
#   
#   -> the main comment block in each of these files gives details of the chip model designed for, 
#   the IDE used, and the compiler used 
#   
#   
#   TO USE THIS REPOSITORY: 
#   - clone entire repo to a convenient place 
#   - open MPLABX IDE 
#   - File->Open & navigate to the cloned folder and open it -> the project will open
